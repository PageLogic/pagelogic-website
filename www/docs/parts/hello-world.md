## Hello World

PageLogic removes all boilerplate stuff,
leaving only what's relevant for your app &mdash; rather than
for the framework you're using.

## Why PageLogic

<div class="container px-4 px-sm-3">
<div class="row">
<app-card :icon="dash-circle" :title="Less of">

**Zero boilerplate** — forget ceremonies like React's `useState()`, `render()` etc. PageLogic handles these details behind the scenes, keeping your code clean and expressive.

**Zero dependencies** — compiled pages only need their accompanying JavaScript file and the PageLogic runtime, both generated by the compiler or the server.

**Super lightweight** — it sports a tiny runtime of less than 4kB (minified, compressed).

**No Virtual DOM** — PageLogic uses direct DOM reflection, a much lighter and efficient solution.

<app-card :icon="plus-circle" :title="More of">

**Isomorphic by design** — with traditional frameworks, running the same logic in both the server and the client can be challenging. PageLogic server does it by default.

**Advanced routing** — the same set of pages can work as a classic website and as a modern [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page\_application) at the same time.

**Simple components** — going from a simple block of code to a component is trivial and this makes developing your own reusable libraries convenient.

**Flexible deployment** — PageLogic pages can be served using the included [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server or [Express](https://expressjs.com/) middleware, or can be used as precompiled HTML.
